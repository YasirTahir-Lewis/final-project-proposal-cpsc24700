        <p>I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client side programming, I will make sure the website looks appealing, attractive and easy to use for new users. For the web server side I will use JSON for all the logical programming since it
            goes well with Javascript. And for the database I will use JSON file as a data file.

        <p>This is going to be a web based application open for public use, when the user lands on the website the very first time they will be able to create their account by filling out the form, then they will be login using thier credentials and save
            their biographic information like phone number, 2nd email, address, attach their resume, their social network links etc. </p>

            <div title="languages, libraries, platforms, hosting">Techonology Overview:</div>
        </h3>
        <p>I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client side programming, I will make sure the website looks appealing, attractive and easy to use for new users. For the web server side I will use Node.js for all the logical programming since
            it goes well with Javascript and NOSQL databases. And for database programming I will be using non relational database most probably MongoDb.
